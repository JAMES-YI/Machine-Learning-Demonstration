# Machine-Learning-Demonstration
Demonstrations for basic ideas in machine learning.

The following are included.

(1) demo_1.m, demonstrate how regularization parameters will affect machine learning models (both the case where a single data set is considered, and the case where multiply data set are considered); demonstrate how the regularization parameters will affect the bias of estimation of machine learning models; demonstrate the bias and variance tradeoff; demonstrate the MSE behavior with respect to regularization parameter; demonstrate how the noise and the size of training data set will affect the performance of machine learning models

(2) demo_2.m, demonstrate basic ideas of binary classification problems; estimation of likelihood distribution; 
design of Bayesian classifier; design of minimum error classification; demonstrate of decision regions; 
use histogram methods to estimate probability distribution, and design Bayes classifier and minimum error classifier

(3) demo_3.m, design a Bayes classifier and a logistic classifier for two dimensional binary classification task
