# Machine-Learning-Demonstration
Demonstrations for basic ideas in machine learning.

The following are included.

(1) demo_1.m, demonstrate how regularization parameters will affect machine learning models (both the case where a single data set is considered, and the case where multiply data set are considered); demonstrate how the regularization parameters will affect the bias of estimation of machine learning models; demonstrate the bias and variance tradeoff; demonstrate the MSE behavior with respect to regularization parameter; demonstrate how the noise and the size of training data set will affect the performance of machine learning models
